# Server by Ron and Ortal

## How to run the project?
In "Ratings2_2" directory you can find "Ratings2_2.sln"
which contains two projects :
1) MVC project - the rating page
2) WebApi project - the server's API

It is important to set both grojects as startup projects, and run them parallely.

After that, you can run the chat project (react) - repo : https://github.com/RonSolomon96/Chat_sample.
